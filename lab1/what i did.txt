LINEAR SEARCH
    Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

    A simple approach is to do linear search, i.e

    1)Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
    2)If x matches with an element, return the index.
    3)If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

    The time complexity of linear algorithm is O(n).

BINARY SEARCH
    Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

    Iterative method to this search is 

    1) Find the middle index from list and find its value.
    2) If the middle index's value is less than x then we shift leftmost index to mid+1 else right most index is changed to mid-1
    3) Steps is continued till we get the value at the middle index. If the item is not found then we return -1.

    The time complexity of linear algorithm is O(log2(n)). It is log base 2.
